Explanation from [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042715/what-difference-between-money-and-out-money.asp)


- A call option with a strike price of $132.50, for example, would be considered ITM if the underlying stock is valued at $135 per share because the strike price has already been exceeded. 
- A call option with a strike price above $135 would be considered OTM because the stock has not yet reached this level.

- A put option with a strike price of $75 is considered in the money if the underlying stock is valued at $72 because the stock price has already moved below the strike. 
- That same put option would be out of the money if the underlying stock is trading at $80.

We will try to improve the user interface so that it is not confusing in the future.
