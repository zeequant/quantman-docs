A call option with a strike price above $135 would be considered OTM because the stock has not yet reached this level. A put option with a strike price of $75 is considered in the money if the underlying stock is valued at $72 because the stock price has already moved below the strike. That same put option would be out of the money if the underlying stock is trading at $80. We will try to improve the user interface so that it is not confusing in the future.
